WELCOME TO THE POKEGIRL LAB! This is the place where the magic happens, where I will attempt to create the bare-bone entries to the pokegirl pokedex.

# Synopsis


This is not a quest, there won't be stories nor characters, this is an attempt of using the akun community as a resource in the attempt to help generating pokegirl pokedex entries.

If you're interested in helping then WELCOME! We will need as many brains as we can handle. From simple things like searching for pictures to trying to come up with concepts/ideas and balancing. I'll be handling the bulk of the effort, but any help is appreciated.

My Discord where the rest of the group/community talks and works over the pokegirl setting. And my Patreon which I'm currently using as a tip-jar but I am working on adding content.

Here s the information you might want to know, though you can also collaborate without needing to read through it all.

Trust me, I've gone through the whole thing multiple times, I'm sure I've lost some of my sanity along the way.

Currently Done Entries:

If you don't want to dive into the deeper end of the stuff, feel free to skip to the next chapter and just stick around to throw around your voice/ideas if you've got any.



# A TLDR of the why
This is the Original Pokedex (Website), open up any of them, you'll see that they're often incomplete and/or needing a lot of work.

The people in charge of this dex have not made things easy for making the vast and broad sweeps that the whole thing needs. And it needed it BADLY, just take a look at the OG evolution Tree (Google Docs).

We splintered off to try our hand at our own version of it. There's no official website, only a Google Drive where we're going to be storing the new entries and other important files.

The objective is to polish the setting and make it readily available for everyone and anyone who might want to use it. I am also in the midst of writing a guideline for any such crazy person :P

Worth noting, if you don't like what's made and/or the themes or broad strokes or details, then don't worry over it, we still plan to help anyone who asks with their own variant.



# The Project
Now, this project began around late December 2019, the group already went through the Pokedex and we made a list of all the breeds that need to be trimmed out, merged, or only tweaked, we've also determined the new evolution trees and settled it all down over here: Pokedex Review File (OneDrive)



The plan is that once a week or once every other week, I will take a day (or two) and dedicate the time into creating the bare-bones entries, with the minimum fleshing out necessary so that if and when anyone else wants to gnaw at it and add some meat, they'd have a good structure to follow.

An example of how we expect a fully fleshed out entry to look like would be something like the Youma (Google Docs) one.



# Making an Entry
How do we make a pokegirl dex entry? We start by taking the Dex Entry Template (Google Docs) and making a personal copy.

Then we use the pieces from the Pokedex Review File (OneDrive) to determine who evolves into what, and where our entry will land on.

We determine the elements/theme of the entry and then use the Enhancement Numbers Checker (Google Docs) to confirm the balancing of the numbered parts of the enhancement and then add in specific enhancements from the Pokegirl Enhancements (Pastebin) list.

After this we use Techniques Part 1 (Pastebin) and Techniques Part 2 (Pastebin) to fill out the techniques (though techniques are a mess and currently ignorable as we're slowly working through them into something that makes more sense).



# Rules
Currently, we are not considering making new pokegirl breeds, we want to finish and polish what there is before we even consider such a thing. That said, the review list is NOT set in stone, ideas and concepts that might be more interesting/apt to the setting regarding certain breeds/trees could/would change the list.

Past that, there are certain rules that need to be strictly followed for every single entry.

***First***, they cannot have been built without a purpose. 
The only people capable of making breeds were Sukebe and Cocooner, and neither were/are in a situation where they'd invest resources into a breed enough to make them viable in the long term without having determined a use/purpose for them.

During the war, they both made breeds geared TO THE WAR. And after the war, Sukebe died, but Cocooner kept going, and she made breeds FOR A PRICE (meaning that leagues commissioned breeds out of her and she agreed for exorbitant prices).

No breed could or would be built if another existing one fulfils the task well enough. No one would invest massive resources into it unless there was an actual benefit or use for them.

In the same vein, though they both undoubtedly created failures, general rule of common sense dictates that neither would make pokegirl prototypes able to reproduce until after they were certain the result was something they desired.

***Second***, the stronger they are, the bigger the drawback.
Strength (Tier) is not directly tied to rarity (scarcity), but they are close enough to have a loose correlation. The stronger the breed the harder it is for them to reproduce. You can explain it away narratively as "a body has issues handling that much power", or you can do so from a game perspective as "if uber girls could have been bred at a decent enough rate, humanity would be swimming in them".

But past that, we want breeds to have a certain balance. Maybe they need to have special needs, or they're insane, or the tamer needs to put in A LOT of effort to get them to that stage, or their powers have specific drawbacks. All in all, we don't want mary-sue breeds, if they are very strong, then they need to have a very big drawback in some place.

***Third***, no "They're the best at!"
In a similar sense, for balancing purposes and a bit of common sense, pokegirls who're one-trick does all (I'm looking at you, OG Archmage) are things we don't want. Writers, questers, readers, and everyone else, should be able to have multiple routes to get someone powerful in a particular field.

To keep in mind that they wouldn't be breeds that overlap in the same way.

Say (with new dex), you wish for "A powerful magic-user". Archmage/Elementalist would be a DnD sorcerer kind of fellow, while the orcish reworked Grand Elf would be something closer to a World of Warcraft Warlock, and the Tatmon/Enchantress would be great for creating magic items.

We want a certain degree of overlap on things, while also keeping them from being same-ish.

***Fourth***, no evolution tree with more than 4 stages.
Just no.

***Fifth***, no more than 3-4 possible evolution options.
Similarly, stuffing a breed into a tree is going to get glares.

***Sixth***, evolution paths need to tell a certain story.
Harder to explain, but all in all you need to consider the evolution tree like a narration about a particular character (unless they're one-off breeds). They start in someplace and move to the next, with some options taking them in vastly different directions.

***Seventh*** and last, please try to help find them a better name.
Just... Some of these girls have been named in such a way it might as well be abuse. Let us seek some better breed name to give them when such a case is found.





And... that's about it.

So welcome! And let's get started.
