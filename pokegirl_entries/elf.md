### Introduction
**What’s the breed’s origins/discovery? Did they have an appearance/impact in the war (if it applies)? What are their distinguishing physical attributes?**

During the Revenge War the Elf made the forests of the world a nightmare place for humans trying to move through them. Their prime tactics were ambushes at the edges of forests and long ranged hit-and-run, as well as plant manipulation to change the otherwise scouted wilderness into seemingly a completely new place. They were led by their queens *insert link here* and have a natural affinity to submit to the will of the breeds designed as their leaders.

Elves range from 90cm to 165cm, with the average of 130cm tall. The tallest Elf recorded was a whopping 175cm. All Elves are thin and slender. Their pointed ears range from human sized ears to towering above their owner’s head. Their skin and eyes wary as much as humans’ does, including albinos.


### Society
**How do these pokegirls tend to live in normal society? What uses/jobs do they tend to gravitate towards? Does there tend to be perceptions about them that are true? False? Exaggerated? Have there been in-Famous/Distinguishable events involving this breed?**

Some Elves respond to a call of the queen *insert a link* live in elven courts. Relations between courts and leagues differ greatly. Those on amicable terms with their league usually help with harvests by amplifying plant growth and calling rains in exchange for human tamers. Courts unwilling to cooperate are called unseelie and turn to kidnapping and robbery to maintain themselves. Most elves are ranch-owned and usually do the same thing as their court kin. Since some Elves live in courts by their own laws some people are suspicious of their entire breed.


### The Individual
**Does the breed have a tendency to show certain personality traits? Taming preferences? How the breed typically interacts with others in the harem? What needs/quirks does the pokegirl have that a tamer should be aware of? What could be a good way to handle them? Is there any particular role or activity the breed is known to enjoy/hate?**

Elves like being in the wilderness. Other than that their specific tastes vary from individual to individual, but it is a fact that an Elf who is only tamed indoors is not a happy Elf. In an urban setting, an Elf will always try to find or create a wilderness area to spend time in. Forbidding an Elf to fill this need is almost certain to result in her leaving at the next Sadie Pokens. In harems Elf tends to ignore or make fun of breeds that aren’t Elves.


### Fighting
**Do they fight? What is a commonly found strategy they tend to use during a battle? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What should be one’s approach to defeat them? How could one improve their combat prowess?**

With any bow, an Elf can hit just about any target anywhere within 150% of that bow’s range, and with arrow shot they can guarantee a lot of damage. Elves prefer ranged combat and their spell repertoires will reflect this, with most wanting to learn spells and magic techniques like rune chain or mana bolt since they can use it to keep enemies away from them. In melee combat the Elf fares poorly. She can use Thorn Cutlass if she has some thorns handy on her. She also can use man-made knives and swords, but prefers to increase the distance and use ranged options instead.



### Feral
**How do ferals of this breed act? What habitat do they prefer? Are there other breeds they’ve been found to interact with (negatively/positively)? Does it tend to be solitary or does the breed tend to move in groups? What’s something to look out for when encountering a feral of this breed? What strategies usually work best for capturing them?**

At the beginning of going feral, Elf will become sleepy and will search a place to hibernate. Elves can be quite creative in this search and feral Elves have been found in caved-in caverns, buried underneath fallen trees and even inside walls. During hibernation Elf doesnt breath, doesn't age, doesn't bleed and her heart doesn't beat, although a wound which would kill a woke Elf will kill a hibernating one. For taming Elf out of this state use of lubricant is recommended.


### Threshold
**Is it possible to threshold into this breed? Are threshold cases into this breed frequent? With what ancestry usually results in turning into this breed? How long does it take? Are there early signs? What about precautions one should take when undergoing threshold into this pokegirl? What’s the best way to handle a thresholded pokegirl in your harem?**

As the young woman becomes an Elf, the magic inherent in the breed causes the transformation to almost always happen overnight without any pain. In most cases the new Elf will immediately respond to the call of the closest Elf court and run away if not restrained. For this reason, threshold Elves are seldom found at Ranches.












### ORIGINAL ENTRY

During the Revenge War the Elf made the forests of the world a nightmare place for humans trying to move through them. Today an Elf is valued for her limited magical skills, her power to grow plants anywhere there’s dirt and the ability to put an arrow pretty much wherever she wants one to go.

Elves stand anywhere between 3 ft and 5ft 4 inches, with the average standing an unimpressive 4ft 3 inches tall. The tallest Elf recorded was a whopping 5ft 7 inches. All Elves are slender, with proportionally long legs, slim hips and typically an A cup bust. Elf pokegirls do show some signs of jealousy towards other Elf breeds that possess larger breasts, but tend to ignore or make fun of breeds that aren’t Elves, regardless of their figure. The pointed ears they possess are considered the defining physical characteristic of the Elf breed and they run the gamut from pointed human sized ears to pointed ears that tower above their owner’s head.

Elves have white skin that can be pure white or have a light green, brown or blue cast to it. Their hair is thick and comes in a variety of colors. An Elf’s eyes are typically blue, green or amber but all of the colors found in nature have been recorded. There are two albino Elves known. Both are in the same court and neither is accorded any special favor or derision because of their condition.

All Elves are inhumanly graceful and this, combined with their ability to command plants, allows them to move through a forest without leaving any sign or sound of their passage. It’s this technique that has given rise to rumors of enhanced speed in the breed since they can run through a forest without having to slow to go around trees or worry about being snagged by branches or vines. The truth is that while they’re fast, they’re no fleeter than a fast human in the open.

Elves prefer ranged combat and their spell repertoires will reflect this, with most wanting to learn spells and magic techniques like rune chain or mana bolt since they can use it to keep enemies away from them. However, they shine when using a bow. With any bow, an Elf can hit just about any target anywhere within that bow’s range, and with arrow shot they can guarantee a lot of damage with each hit. In fact, when using a bow, an Elf can extend that bow’s maximum range to 150%.

In melee combat the Elf fares poorly. She naturally knows Thorn Cutlass, but must find a thorny plant to harvest for thorns with which to use the technique. For this reason most Elves have some thorns handy in a pocket or pouch. She has no aversion to using manmade knives and swords and with her enhanced strength can hit hard, but the tendency is to strike enough to give an enemy pause and then withdraw to open the range so she can switch back to her preferred ranged techniques.

Elves like being in the wilderness and will try to convince their tamer to tame them outside, be it in the backyard garden in a town or in the wilderness. Other than that their specific tastes vary from individual to individual, but it is a fact that an Elf who is only tamed indoors is not a happy Elf.

This love of the wilderness extends to other parts of an Elf’s life. In an urban setting, an Elf will constantly try to find or create a wilderness area for her to spend time in. A tamer living in the city with an Elf in his harem will quickly find that his back yard has become a tiny forest and his swimming pool a pond filled with aquatic plants, fish and frogs. Forbidding an Elf to fill this need is almost certain to result in her leaving at the next Sadie Pokens.

Elves can command plants to grow, causing them to sprout and go through their life cycle at double the normal rate. More experienced Elves can triple or quadruple this growth speed and can make a field of crops mature overnight once they’ve laid fruit. Combined with their ability to make small fields of rain whenever they want, this has made them very popular in agriculture, especially when combined with the Boobisaur to keep the fields fertile. The ability to make it rain has also made Elves popular with people traveling through or living in arid regions, although any oasis that an Elf creates will die when she leaves.

There is a spell unique to the Elf breed. It is a spell which asks a willing tree to provide the Elf with a bow, quiver and arrows made from the heartwood of the tree. These are alive and thrive as the Elf thrives. Arrows grow inside the quiver and can be planted to produce trees or used as weapons. Arrows that are not deliberately planted will not sprout and once an arrow is rooted it becomes a normal sapling of whatever tree species gave the bow and quiver. If the bow or quiver is taken from the Elf against her will, it will die in a matter of days, even if given to another Elf. If the Elf is killed, her living bow and quiver will also die. Elves who know this spell cannot teach it to a non Elf and threshold Elves don’t know it until taught by an Elf who does. A living bow has triple the range of a nonliving bow of the same design. This spell can also be used to produce a living sword, dagger or staff. Edged weapons created by this spell are as hard as the hardest steel and never dull while the living staff is often used for powerful enchantments by more experienced spellcasting Elves.

When an Elf begins to go feral, she gets sleepy and stays that way. If taming is not an option, almost instinctively she will seek out a safe place before she goes completely feral. Elves can be quite creative in this search and feral Elves have been found in caved in caverns, buried underneath fallen trees and rarely inside wall dead spaces. When an Elf goes completely feral, she goes into complete hibernation. Her breathing and her heart stops and, other than the fact that she doesn’t decay, she appears completely dead. In this state she does not age. If injured she does not bleed, but if given a wound that would immediately kill a living Elf, a feral Elf will immediately die. An Elf can only be revived from this suspended animation by being tamed. Use of a lubricant is recommended.

Because the Elf can be evolved by the application of a Leaf Stone to a Bimbo, by using a Bimbo pokéwoman an Elf pokéwoman can be produced. This has allowed human children to be born from Elves and, because of this, there are rare cases of threshold into Elves. As the young woman becomes an Elf, the magic inherent in the breed causes the transformation to almost always happen overnight and without any pain. In most cases the new Elf will immediately respond to the call of the closest Elf court and run away if not restrained. For this reason, threshold Elves are seldom found at Ranches.
